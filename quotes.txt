Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
The future depends on what you do today.
Success is the sum of small efforts repeated day in and day out.
Push yourself because no one else is going to do it for you.
The only bad workout is the one that didn't happen.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
Fitness is not about being better than someone else; it's about being better than you used to be.
